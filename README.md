#############################################

This app was made with specific data structures using the language python.
It was tested on Windows 10. on August, 2019.

This application is still on Beta.

This app is intended to be a game which other programmers can play and also
see the source code. So that they can actually have this as a guide
when programming data structures. 

Info:
'+' This is a plus point, it will add a node to your snake
'*' This is a less point, it will remove the last node on your snake

Controls:
Up Key: Moves the snake upwards
Down Key: Moves the snake down
Left Key:  Changes direction to the left
Right Key: Changes direction to the right


You can create the reports of the structures that have been made on the 
file. For example, you can see the data structure of each node of the 
snake, as well as the score for every plus point. 


These are dinamic structures, meaning that they keeep
on changing. In this case we delete/add nodes for every 
bite that the snake goes through. 

You need to get 20 points to end the gme or crash onto yourself
as the snake.

When you get to 15 points the speed of the snake doubles. Meaning this is the next lvl.
